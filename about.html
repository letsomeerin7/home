        <p class="about">Hi friends, I’m thrilled you’re here! I’m Erin Jamison and this is the online home for Let Some Erin. So, what are we doing here? I’m glad you asked.</p>
        <p class="about">Pretty much my entire life I’ve struggled with confidence, self-esteem, and identity. I didn’t know who I am or what I want or how worthy I am of all the love and good things in life. This last year, though, I’ve experienced some real breakthroughs and have learned to recognize my inherent value, my needs, and my goals.</p>
        <p class="about">I feel like my whole life I’ve been asleep, letting life happen around me while dreaming about what it could be. This last year I opened my eyes and woke up. Now, it’s time to start the day and start LIVING.</p>
        <p class="about">That being said, I by no means have all the answers - I’m still going through my journey, and really, I’ve just gotten started! But I want to share the things I’m learning in the hopes that you’ll join me in this transformation, which is how this podcast came to be. So that we can go through it together and come out better than we ever imagined or thought possible.</p>

        <p class="about">Gratitude is the key to happiness. It’s something my dad has reminded my sisters and me of countless times since we were little, and never ceases to be true. So, in that spirit, I want to take this opportunity to thank all the people who have helped me get where I am now, whether they’re aware of their influence or not.</p>
        <p class="about">First, thank you to all of the fearless (or maybe terrified, but do it anyway) creators who follow their hearts and guts to produce things that are honest and real. Things that make us feel seen and less alone, that inspire and encourage us in our own authenticity and crazy dreams. There are so many people out there creating dangerously it’s amazing.</p>
        <p class="about">Specifically, Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, whose podcast is the first one that I really fell in love with. They are huge reasons why I’ve started this adventure and I so appreciate their willingness to be imperfect, make mistakes, and own them – it gave me permission to do it too. Brené Brown, who presents her research that is powerful and healing, but so challenging, in such a human and approachable way. I will never think about vulnerability or shame the same way again, and I will be a better person, friend, and partner for it. Julia Cameron, who taught me that to be is to be creative. Her book was integral in me being able to recognize all that’s within me and own my dreams.</p>
        <p class="about">There are so many more, and I’m sure you’ll hear me speak about many, if not all of them, at some point or another over the course of this podcast. But I really wanted to take the time to specifically acknowledge these powerful women who I feel forever indebted to in the best way possible.</p>

        <p class="about">Next, I want to thank a few special friends and teachers. Erika Gottfredson, one of the kindest, most loving souls I’ve ever met, who showed me how to see myself as God sees me. Heather Ong, the best of adventure partners. Mitchell Steele, honorary sister and inspiration to be unapologetic. Sarah Taylor, whose generosity, wisdom, and healing has helped me move emotional and spiritual mountains.</p>
        <p class="about">Now best for last, thank you to my wonderful family. To my loving parents who want the best for me and have always supported me, even when it maybe makes them a little nervous. You gave me my set of values, the most important thing to have. Dad, you show me what it means to work hard and take risks. Mom, I like to say that you’re the reason I’m extra (which I love). But more importantly, you show me how to be thoughtful and giving.</p>
        <p class="about">Holly, Herler, you’re my best friend. You see me for who I am, down to the roots. You constantly amaze me with your big brain (seriously, you are SO SMART!), your dedication, drive, generosity, and compassion. And Robin, you always inspire me to be a kinder human. You have the biggest heart of anyone I’ve ever met, little turtledove. Your light shines so brightly it’s impossible not to see and you always bring joy to those around you. I love you, my seesters. I love you, Mom and Dad. I’m so lucky I get to call you my family.</p>
        <p class="about">And thank God for making me who I am and blessing me with this beautiful life that gets better all the time.</p>
